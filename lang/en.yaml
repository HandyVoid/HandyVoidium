    definition: A palindrome is a type of word play that involves words, phrases, numbers or sequences that read the same backward or forward. The word palindrome comes from Greek roots that mean "running back". Palindromes have been used for centuries in various languages and cultures.
    examples:

    facts: Palindromes can be simple or complex, funny or serious. Some palindromes are very long and require creativity and skill to construct. The longest single-word palindrome in English is "tattarrattat" (a knock on the door), coined by James Joyce in his novel "Ulysses". The longest single-word palindrome in any language is "saippuakivikauppias" (a soapstone vendor) in Finnish.
